/**
 * @class KGameRenderer  kgamerenderer.h <KGameRenderer>
 * @since 4.6
 * @short Cache-enabled rendering of SVG themes.
 *
 * KGameRenderer is a light-weight rendering framework for the rendering of
 * SVG themes (as represented by KgTheme) into pixmap caches.
 *
 * @section terminology Terminology
 *
 * @li Themes in the context of KGameRenderer are KgTheme instances. The theme
 *     selection by a KgRenderer can be managed by a KgThemeProvider.
 * @li A sprite is either a single pixmap ("non-animated sprites") or a sequence
 *     of pixmaps which are shown consecutively to produce an animation
 *     ("animated sprites"). Non-animated sprites correspond to a single element
 *     with the same key in the SVG theme file. The element keys for the pixmaps
 *     of an animated sprite are produced by appending the frameSuffix() to the
 *     sprite key.
 *
 * @section clients Access to the pixmaps
 *
 * Sprite pixmaps can be retrieved from KGameRenderer in the main thread using
 * the synchronous KGameRenderer::spritePixmap() method. However, it is highly
 * recommended to use the asynchronous interface provided by the interface class
 * KGameRendererClient. A client corresponds to one pixmap and registers itself
 * with the corresponding KGameRenderer instance to get notified when a new
 * pixmap is available.
 *
 * For QGraphicsView-based applications, the KGameRenderedItem class provides a
 * QGraphicsPixmapItem which is a KGameRendererClient and displays the pixmap
 * for a given sprite.
 *
 * @section strategies Rendering strategy
 *
 * For each theme, KGameRenderer keeps two caches around: an in-process cache of
 * QPixmaps, and a disk cache containing QImages (powered by KImageCache). You
 * therefore will not need to implement any caching for the pixmaps provided by
 * KGameRenderer.
 *
 * When requests from a KGameRendererClient cannot be served immediately because
 * the requested sprite is not in the caches, a rendering request is sent to a
 * worker thread.
 *
 * @section legacy Support for legacy themes
 *
 * When porting applications to KGameRenderer, you probably have to support
 * the format of existing themes. KGameRenderer provides the frameBaseIndex()
 * and frameSuffix() properties for this purpose. It is recommended not to
 * change these properties in new applications.
 *
