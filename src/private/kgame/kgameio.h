/**
 *  \class KGameIO kgameio.h <KGame/KGameIO>
 *
 *  \short Base class for IO devices for games
 *
 *  This is the master class for
 *  creating IO game devices. You cannot use it directly.
 *  Either take one of the classes derived from it or
 *  you have to create your own IO class derived from it (more probably).
 *
 *  The idea behind this class is to provide a common interface
 *  for input devices into your game. By programming a KGameIO
 *  device you need not distinguish the actual IO in the game
 *  anymore. All work is done by the IO's. This allows very
 *  easy reuse in other games as well.
 *  A further advantage of using the IO's is that you can exchange
 *  the control of a player at runtime. E.g. you switch a player
 *  to be controlled by the computer or vice versa.
 *
 *  To achieve this you have to make all of your player inputs through a
 *  KGameIO. You will usually call KGameIO::sendInput to do so.
