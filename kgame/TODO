- 28.02.2001: Direct computer player for kpoker like games support needs to be 
              improved. UPDATE (01/10/06): but what is needed there?
- 05.03.2001: Documentation. I am thinking of an explaination of the 
              class + methods and example code for the "key" methods. A sample
              implementation in a small game (like the current kdenonbeta/kgame
              but with a real sense - mabye use the QT tic-tac-toe example?)
              would be very great (this could be stuff of a tutorial instead of
              KGame documentation)
              MH: Even better idea
- 03.06.2001: can KGameNetwork::sendSystemMessage be made protected (maybe using
              friends)? sendSystenMessage AND sendMessage is very confusing to
              the user...
- 03.06.2001: can we translate the group of a KPlayer? Probably not as there are
              no international connections possible then... maybe a group id?
- 05.06.2001: KGameDialog::saveConfig(KConfig*) might be useful (as well as
              KGameDialog::loadConfig(KConfig*). Should set an own group in the
              config file (setGroup("KGameDialog")). Problem: shalll network
              settings be saved? Could be used for startup configuration (i.e.
              load the config of the previous game) otherwise.
- 21.06.2001: KPlayerPropertyArray does not yet support at() and operator[]
              assignments. Need to check whether the method from QBitArray
              can be applied
- 15.08.2001: KGamePropertyList doesn't honor Policies - only Clean is
              possible current
- 02.04.2001: VERY DANGEROUS: property1=property2 does NOT assign the values, e.g. int
              but assignes the whole property, i.e. you have then two properties with
              the same id and everything is wrong
              01/09/09: FIXED! (AB) TODO: check if this behavior also appears in
	      KGamePropertyList and KGamePropertyArray. Althogh this should not
	      be the case
- 23.09.2001: does the virtual destructor make sense for KGamePropertyBase?
- 29.09.2001: GGZ integration. I (Andi) already volunteered for this - it's just
              here so that I don't forget it
- 06.10.2001: add KGamePropertyHandler::setDebug(false) to clear all debug names
              (and to not accept new names) of KGameProperty. Will save some
              memory
- 06.10.2001: If one kicks a player (in KGameDialog) the client should be kicked
              as well. Perhaps always disconnect a client when all players from
              it have disappeared?
- 07.10.2001: display (List) or (Array) for KGameProperty[List|Array] in
              KGameDebugDialog as value
