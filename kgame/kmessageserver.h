/**
  @short A server for message sending and broadcasting, using TCP/IP connections.

  An object of this class listens for incoming connections via TCP/IP sockets and
  creates KMessageSocket objects for every established connection. It receives
  messages from the "clients", analyses them and processes an appropriate
  reaction.

  You can also use other KMessageIO objects with KMessageServer, not only
  TCP/IP socket based ones. Use addClient to connect via an object of any
  KMessageIO subclass. (For clients within the same process, you can e.g. use
  KMessageDirect.) This object already has to be connected.

  The messages are always packages of an arbitrary length. The format of the messages
  is given below. All the data is stored and received with QDataStream, to be
  platform independant.

  Setting up a KMessageServer can be done like this:

  \code
    KMessageServer *server = new KMessageServer ();
    server->initNetwork (TCP/IP-Portnumber);
  \endcode

  Usually that is everything you will do. There are a lot of public methods to
  administrate the object (maximum number of clients, finding clients, removing
  clients, setting the admin client, ...), but this functionality can also
  be done by messages from the clients. So you can administrate the object completely
  on remote.

  If you want to extend the Server for your own needs (e.g. additional message types),
  you can either create a subclass and overwrite the method processOneMessage.
  (But don't forget to call the method of the superclass!) Or you can connect to
  the signal messageReceived, and analyse the messages there.

  Every client has a unique ID, so that messages can be sent to another dedicated
  client or a list of clients.

  One of the clients (the admin) has a special administration right. Some of the
  administration messages can only be used with him. The admin can give the admin
  status to another client. You can send a message to the admin by using clientID 0.
  This is always interpreted as the admin client, independant of its real clientID.

  Here is a list of the messages the KMessageServer understands:
  &lt;&lt; means, the value is inserted into the QByteArray using QDataStream. The
  messageIDs (REQ_BROADCAST, ...) are of type Q_UINT32.

  - QByteArray << static_cast&lt;Q_UINT32>( REQ_BROADCAST ) << raw_data

    When the server receives this message, it sends the following message to
    ALL connected clients (a broadcast), where the raw_data is left unchanged:
       QByteArray << static_cast &lt;Q_UINT32>( MSG_BROADCAST ) << clientID << raw_data
       Q_UINT32 clientID; // the ID of the client that sent the broadcast request

  - QByteArray << static_cast&lt;Q_UINT32>( REQ_FORWARD ) << client_list << raw_data
    QValueList &lt;Q_UINT32> client_list; // list of receivers

    When the server receives this message, it sends the following message to
    the clients in client_list:
        QByteArray << static_cast&lt;Q_UINT32>( MSG_FORWARD ) << senderID << client_list << raw_data
        Q_UINT32 senderID;  // the sender of the forward request
        QValueList &lt;Q_UINT32> client_list; // a copy of the receiver list

    Note: Every client receives the message as many times as he is in the client_list.
    Note: Since the client_list is sent to all the clients, every client can see who else
          got the message. If you want to prevent this, send a single REQ_FORWARD
          message for every receiver.

  - QByteArray << static_cast&lt;Q_UINT32>( REQ_CLIENT_ID )

    When the server receives this message, it sends the following message to
    the asking client:
        QByteArray << static_cast&lt;Q_UINT32>( ANS_CLIENT_ID ) << clientID
        Q_UINT32 clientID;  // The ID of the client who asked for it

    Note: This answer is also automatically sent to a new connected client, so that he
          can store his ID. The ID of a client doesn't change during his lifetime, and is
          unique for this KMessageServer.

  - QByteArray << static_cast&lt;Q_UINT32>( REQ_ADMIN_ID )

    When the server receives this message, it sends the following message to
    the asking client:
        QByteArray << ANS_ADMIN_ID << adminID
        Q_UINT32 adminID;  // The ID of the admin

    Note: This answer is also automatically sent to a new connected client, so that he
          can see if he is the admin or not. It will also be sent to all connected clients
          when a new admin is set (see REQ_ADMIN_CHANGE).

  - QByteArray << static_cast&lt;Q_UINT32>( REQ_ADMIN_CHANGE ) << new_admin
    Q_UINT32 new_admin;  // the ID of the new admin, or 0 for no admin

    When the server receives this message, it sets the admin to the new ID. If no client
    with that ID exists, nothing happens. With new_admin == 0 no client is a admin.
    ONLY THE ADMIN ITSELF CAN USE THIS MESSAGE!

    Note: The server sends a ANS_ADMIN_ID message to every connected client.

  - QByteArray << static_cast&lt;Q_UINT32>( REQ_REMOVE_CLIENT ) << client_list
    QValueList &lt;Q_UINT32> client_list; // The list of clients to be removed

    When the server receives this message, it removes the clients with the ids stored in
    client_list, disconnecting the connection to them.
    ONLY THE ADMIN CAN USE THIS MESSAGE!

    Note: If one of the clients is the admin himself, he will also be deleted.
          Another client (if any left) will become the new admin.

  - QByteArray << static_cast&lt;Q_UINT32>( REQ_MAX_NUM_CLIENTS ) << maximum_clients
    Q_INT32 maximum_clients; // The maximum of clients connected, or infinite if -1

    When the server receives this message, it limits the number of clients to the number given,
    or sets it unlimited for maximum_clients == -1.
    ONLY THE ADMIN CAN USE THIS MESSAGE!

    Note: If there are already more clients, they are not affected. It only prevents new Clients
          to be added. To assure this limit, remove clients afterwards (REQ_REMOVE_CLIENT)

  - QByteArray  << static_cast&lt;Q_UINT32>( REQ_CLIENT_LIST )

    When the server receives this message, it answers by sending a list of IDs of all the clients
    that are connected at the moment. So it sends the following message to the asking client:
        QByteArray << static_cast&lt;Q_UINT32>( ANS_CLIENT_LIST ) << clientList
        QValueList &lt;Q_UINT32> clientList;  // The IDs of the connected clients

    Note: This message is also sent to every new connected client, so that he knows the other
          clients.

  There are two more messages that are sent from the server to the every client automatically
  when a new client connects or a connection to a client is lost:

        QByteArray << static_cast&lt;Q_UINT32>( EVNT_CLIENT_CONNECTED ) << clientID;
        Q_UINT32 clientID;   // the ID of the new connected client

        QByteArray << static_cast&lt;Q_UINT32>( EVNT_CLIENT_DISCONNECTED ) << clientID;
        Q_UINT32 clientID;   // the ID of the client that lost the connection
        Q_UINT8 broken;      // 1 if the network connection was closed, 0 if it was disconnected
                             // on purpose
