 * In this file you find a couple of defines that indicate whether a specific
 * feature or function is present in this version of the KGame library.
 *
 * You don't need this for KDE CVS, but for games that live outside of KDE CVS
 * it may be very helpful and a lot easier than writing configure scripts for
 * this task.
 *
 * All defines are prefixed with KGAME_ to avoid conflicts.
