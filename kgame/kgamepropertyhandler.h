/**
 * The KGamePropertyHandler class is some kind of a collection class for
 * KGameProperty. You usually don't have to create one yourself, as both @ref
 * KPlayer and @ref KGame provide a handler. In most cases you do not even have
 * to care about the KGamePropertHandler. @ref KGame and @ref KPlayer implement
 * all features of KGamePropertyHandler so you will rather use it there.
 *
 * You have to use the KGamePropertyHandler as parent for all @ref KGameProperty
 * objects but you can also use @ref KPlayer or @ref KGame as parent - then @ref
 * KPlayer::dataHandler or @ref KGame::dataHandler will be used. 
 *
 * Every KGamePropertyHandler must have - just like every @ref KGameProperty -
 * a unique ID. This ID is provided either in the constructor or in @ref
 * registerHandler. The ID is used to assign an incoming message (e.g. a changed
 * property) to the correct handler. Inside the handler the property ID is used
 * to change the correct property. 
 *
 * The constructor or @ref registerHandler takes 3 addittional arguments: a
 * receiver and two slots. The first slot is connected to @ref
 * signalSendMessage, the second to @ref signalPropertyChanged. You must provide
 * these in order to use the KGamePropertyHandler. 
 *
 * The most important function of KGamePropertyHandler is @ref processMessage
 * which assigns an incoming value to the correct property. 
 *
 * A KGamePropertyHandler is also used - indirectly using @ref emitSignal - to
 * emit a signal when the value of a property changes. This is done this way
 * because a @ref KGameProperty does not inherit @ref QObject because of memory
 * advantages. Many games can have dozens or even hundreds of @ref KGameProperty
 * objects so every additional variable in @ref KGameProperty would be
 * multiplied. 
 *
 * @short A collection class for @ref KGameProperty objects
