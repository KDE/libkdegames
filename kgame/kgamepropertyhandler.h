/**
 * @short A collection class for KGameProperty objects
 *
 * The KGamePropertyHandler class is some kind of a collection class for
 * KGameProperty. You usually don't have to create one yourself, as both
 * KPlayer and KGame provide a handler. In most cases you do not even have
 * to care about the KGamePropertHandler. KGame and KPlayer implement
 * all features of KGamePropertyHandler so you will rather use it there.
 *
 * You have to use the KGamePropertyHandler as parent for all KGameProperty
 * objects but you can also use KPlayer or KGame as parent - then
 * KPlayer::dataHandler or KGame::dataHandler will be used. 
 *
 * Every KGamePropertyHandler must have - just like every KGameProperty -
 * a unique ID. This ID is provided either in the constructor or in
 * registerHandler. The ID is used to assign an incoming message (e.g. a changed
 * property) to the correct handler. Inside the handler the property ID is used
 * to change the correct property. 
 *
 * The constructor or registerHandler takes 3 addittional arguments: a
 * receiver and two slots. The first slot is connected to
 * signalSendMessage, the second to signalPropertyChanged. You must provide
 * these in order to use the KGamePropertyHandler. 
 *
 * The most important function of KGamePropertyHandler is processMessage
 * which assigns an incoming value to the correct property. 
 *
 * A KGamePropertyHandler is also used - indirectly using emitSignal - to
 * emit a signal when the value of a property changes. This is done this way
 * because a KGameProperty does not inherit QObject because of memory
 * advantages. Many games can have dozens or even hundreds of KGameProperty
 * objects so every additional variable in KGameProperty would be
 * multiplied.
