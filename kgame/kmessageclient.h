/**
  @short A client to connect to a KMessageServer

  This class implements a client that can connect to a KMessageServer object.
  It can be used to exchange messages between clients.

  Usually you will connect the signals broadcastReceived and forwardReceived to
  some specific slots. In these slot methods you can analyse the messages that are
  sent to you from other clients.

  To send messages to other clients, use the methods sendBroadcast() (to send to all
  clients) or sendForward() (to send to a list of selected clients).

  If you want to communicate with the KMessageServer object directly (on a more low
  level base), use the method sendServerMessage to send a command to the server and
  connect to the signal serverMessageReceived to see all the incoming messages.
  In that case the messages must be of the format specified in KMessageServer.

    Calling this method disconnects any earlier connection, and uses the new KMessageIO
    object instead. This object gets owned by the KMessageClient object, so don't delete

    there are no important messages from the old server not yet delivered.

    our new ID.
