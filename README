This directory contains the library for the kdegames packege.
It is a collection of functions used by some games or which
are useful for other games.

Packagers note: it is recommended to put the directory "carddecks" into a separate
package, as not all games using libkdegames use the carddecks as well.

Contents:
  kcarddialog: Access to carddeck selection and administration
               for cardgames
  kstdgameaction: just like kstdaction this provides some default action for
                  kde games. games often use different entries than other apps
                  (like "game" instead of "file"), so use this if possible
  kgamemisc: some static method i didn't know a good class name for. it
             currently features "randomName()" which will just give you a random name from
             a list (translators note: happy translating ;) i copied kde-common/accounts
             for this so there are nearly 300 entries...)

if you use libkdegames in your game please also add
KGlobal::locale()->insertCatalogue("libkdegames");
to main()
This will add libkdegames.pot to your game and therefore all libkdegames 
strings get translated.
