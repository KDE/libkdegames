 * You can leave the player part out if you don't need it - there won't be any
 * difference.

/**
 * @short The base class for chat widgets
 *
 * This is the base class for both KChat and KGameChat. KGameChat is the class
 * you want to use if you write a KGame based game as it will do most things for
 * you. KChat is more or less the same but not KGame dependant
 *
 * KChatBase provides a complete chat widget, featuring different sending means
 * (e.g. "send to all", "send to player1", "send to group2" and so on - see 
 * addSendingEntry). It also provides full auto-completion capabilities (see
 * KCompletion and KLineEdit) which defaults to disabled. The user can
 * change this by right-clicking on the KLineEdit widget and selecting the
 * desired behaviour. You can also change this manually by calling 
 * setCompletionMode.
 *
 * To make KChatBase useful you have to overwrite at least returnPressed.
 * Here you should send the message to all of your clients (or just some of
 * them, depending on sendingEntry).
 *
 * To add a message just call addMessage with the nickname of the player
 * who sent the message and the message itself. If you don't want to use
 * layoutMessage by any reason you can also call addItem directly. But you
 * should better replace layoutMessage instead.
 *
 * You probably don't want to use the abstract class KChatBase directly but use
 * one of the derived classess KChat or KGameChat. The latter is the
 * widget of choice if you develop a KGame application as you don't have to
 * do anything but providing a KGame object.
